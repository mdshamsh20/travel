       <P class="para"> While all of India is filled with stunning places to visit, Karnataka is one of the few states that has to offer it all.

        When it comes to hill stations, Karnataka offers some of the best and beautiful hill retreats in the country. The state boasts picturesque hilly retreats that are a paradise for nature lovers, wildlife explorers and adventure seekers.
