            <b>PELLING</b> is a beautiful town in West Sikkim, most popular for breathtaking views of the Kanchenjunga peak and the Himalayas. Located at a high altitude of 6800ft, Pelling is the ideal place for exploring the Himalayan views, without any of the harshness of the high mountains. It is the closest view possible apart from mountain trekking. Located at 115 km from Gangtok, Pelling is also known for its cultural heritage and history.

            Pelling has rightfully emerged as the second most popular traveller halt in Sikkim, right after Gangtok. It has plenty to offer to the nature lover, the culturist, the urban traveller, and is the ideal cool summer break on a vacation trip. In structure, it is little more than a few roads flanked by hotels and homestays offering views of the Kanchenjunga. But step out of the main town, and you are a short distance from monasteries, waterfalls, temples and lakes. Nature presents itself in all its glory around Pelling.

            <b>LACHUNG</b> is a small hill town tucked in the Himalayas of North Sikkim, at an altitude of 3000 ft above MSL. The drive to Lachung is as scenic as the town itself. Accessible by road from Gangtok, which is located at a distance of 120km, Lachung is a town out of some old classic book. Most of the houses are made of wood, surrounded by small kitchen gardens around winding roads, small stepped grassy fields, wandering cows, interrupted every now and then by a small shop. Here, you would feel like you have been transported to a different time, except that you still get to use your smartphone when you get the network.
            Lachung offers great views of snow capped mountain peaks around the year. It is surrounded by waterfalls on the mountain routes. In the winter season, the region receives snow. The best time to visit is during the summer or autumn, avoiding the monsoon which brings landslides, and winter, during which many routes are closed due to snowfall.
